# DSCI_525_Group26

## Welcome

Welcome to our group project Repo!

This document is designed to give an introduction to the purpose of the project and some guidance for contributing and using this content. 

## About the Project

This repository is for the group 26 of the Masters of Data Science (MDS) DSCI 525 project. The project is designed to give us experience with wrangling, analysing, and otherwise working with big data. 

In particular, we are building and deploying ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~6 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

We will be familiarizing ourselves with an API to access the data hosted on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681). At the end of the project, you will be able to access our machine learning model deployed in the cloud for your own use!

## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributions. At this point, we are not accepting coding contributions as this project is intended for our own educational purposes. However, if you notice an issue in our repository, we would greatly appreciate if you could create an issue with the problem.
